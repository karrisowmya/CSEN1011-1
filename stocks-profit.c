/*I want to know how much money I could have made yesterday if I'd been trading Apple stocks all day.
So I grabbed Apple's stock prices from yesterday and put them in an array called stock_prices, where:
The indices are the time (in minutes) past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
The values are the price (in US dollars) of one share of Apple stock at that time.
So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, that means stock_prices[60] = 500.
Write program in C that the best profit I could have made from one purchase and one sale of one share of Apple stock yesterday.
For example:
  stock_prices = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]
the program should returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)
No "shorting"—you need to buy before you can sell. Also, you can't buy and sell in the same time step—at least 1 minute has to pass. */

int main() {
  int stock_prices[SIZE];
  int n,max=0;
  printf("Enter the number of stock prices: ");
  scanf("%d", &n);
  printf("The stock prices are ...\n");

    scanf("%d", &stock_prices[i]);
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
      for (int j=i; j<n; j++) 
              if ((stock_prices[j] - stock_prices[i]) > max)
          max = stock_prices[j] - stock_prices[i];
        
  printf("The maximum profit that is possible is %d\n", max);
  return 0;
}

/* Output: 
Case - 01
Enter the number of stock prices: 6

The maximum profit that is possible is 6
Case - 02
Enter the number of stock prices: 6

Case - 03
Enter the number of stock prices: 6

Instead of 3 nested for loops is there a better way?
